# Extract Figma

This skill mirrors the `/extract-figma` workflow.
Use it to turn a Figma URL or frame into an implementation-ready design spec file that other workflows can reuse without re-reading Figma.

## Inputs

- Figma URL or frame URL
- Optional output slug in kebab-case

## Output

- `docs/ai/requirements/figma-{name}.md`

The output must be detailed enough to:

1. implement the UI without reopening Figma
2. validate implementation against the design later

## Codex Tool Mapping

- Claude Figma MCP reads -> use the available Figma integration or repository-provided workflow if present
- Claude `Read/Write/Edit` -> inspect files with shell tools and edit with `apply_patch`
- Claude `AskUserQuestion` -> ask the user directly only when the file, frame, or next extraction target is unclear

## Workflow

### 1. Validate input and setup

Parse:

- the Figma URL
- the target output name
- the output path `docs/ai/requirements/figma-{name}.md`

If the file already exists:

- if `status: complete`, ask whether to overwrite or stop
- if `status: partial`, resume from the unchecked extraction items

Do not continue if the Figma source cannot be accessed.

### 2. Scan layout before detailed extraction

Always inspect the frame structure first to estimate complexity:

- frame name and path
- top-level sections
- approximate nesting depth
- approximate node count

Choose strategy:

- low complexity -> full extraction
- medium or high complexity -> progressive extraction

Report the chosen strategy briefly before continuing.

### 3. Use the right extraction strategy

#### Full extraction

Use this when the frame is small enough to capture in one pass.

Extract:

- frame overview
- layout hierarchy
- design tokens
- component specs with states and variants
- responsive specs
- assets
- interaction patterns
- validation notes

Set `status: complete` unless some sections were intentionally skipped.

#### Progressive extraction

Use this when the frame is large or complex.

First pass:

- extract only the layout structure and section inventory
- create placeholders for each top-level section
- set `status: partial`

Then iterate section by section:

- design tokens
- individual UI sections such as header, hero, form, sidebar
- responsive specs
- assets

After each extracted section:

- replace the placeholder with real content
- update extraction-status checkboxes
- ask which remaining section to extract next when needed

### 4. Extract exact specs only

Never guess or approximate values.
Capture exact values for:

- colors with hex codes and usage notes
- typography with family, size, weight, line-height, tracking when relevant
- spacing scale and repeated layout values
- shadows and border radius
- component dimensions
- padding, gaps, and margins
- states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error, success when present
- variants: size, style, intent
- responsive differences by breakpoint
- icons, images, and export-sensitive assets

### 5. Write the output file

Follow `docs/ai/requirements/figma-template.md` when it exists.
If the template is missing, use this fallback structure:

1. frontmatter
2. reference
3. frame overview
4. layout structure
5. design tokens
6. component specifications
7. responsive specifications
8. assets
9. interaction patterns
10. validation notes
11. extraction status

Frontmatter should include:

```yaml
---
frame_url: {url}
frame_name: {frame name}
file_name: {figma file name}
extracted: {YYYY-MM-DD}
status: complete
---
```

Use `status: partial` if any planned extraction sections remain unfinished.

## Completion Checklist

- all values are exact, not inferred
- all important components include states and variants
- responsive changes are explicit
- large frames keep resumable extraction status
- the output is sufficient for implementation without reopening Figma

## Error Handling

- If Figma access fails, stop and tell the user what is missing.
- If the URL is invalid or the frame cannot be found, ask for the correct frame.
- If a partial file exists, resume from it instead of starting over by default.
- If `docs/ai/requirements/figma-template.md` is missing, use the fallback structure and continue.

## Integration with Create Plan

`create-plan` should read the generated `figma-{name}.md` file.
If that file does not exist yet, `create-plan` should stop guessing and tell the user to run `/extract-figma` first.
