description: Use when the user asks to implement work from an existing feature planning doc in `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`, resume an incomplete phase, or keep the plan checkboxes in sync with code changes.

# Execute Plan

Use this skill to implement a feature from its planning doc with small, reviewable changes.
By default, continue through all remaining incomplete phases in order until the feature is complete or a real blocker stops progress.
Only limit execution to a single phase when the user explicitly asks for one phase, a specific phase, or a resume point that should not advance further.

## Inputs

- Feature name in kebab-case, or a direct path to the planning doc
- Existing planning doc: `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`
- Optional execution scope:
  - all remaining incomplete phases in order by default
  - a single named or implied phase only when the user explicitly requests it

## Codex Tool Mapping

- Claude `Read/Edit/Write` -> inspect files with shell tools and edit with `apply_patch`
- Claude `AskUserQuestion` -> ask the user directly only when the plan is ambiguous enough to risk wrong behavior
- Claude phase/task automation -> use `update_plan` for active todos and keep the planning doc checkboxes in sync manually
- Claude background reads -> parallelize only independent file reads with `multi_tool_use.parallel`

## Workflow

### 1. Load execution context

Read:

- the planning doc
- `docs/ai/planning/feature-template.md`
- `docs/ai/project/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`
- `docs/ai/project/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

If the planning doc contains design or theme sections, use those sections as the design source of truth.

If the planning doc contains codebase context, use it to find the right files and patterns quickly.

Do not re-run Figma extraction during execution unless the user explicitly asks.

### 2. Detect execution scope and phases

Parse the planning doc and identify:

- total phases
- completed phases
- incomplete phases in order
- whether the user requested a specific phase or a single-phase resume

If the doc has no explicit phases, treat the entire `Implementation Plan` section as one phase.

Skip completed phases.
Default to executing every remaining incomplete phase in order.
Limit execution to one phase only when the user explicitly says to stop after that phase or names a specific phase to resume.

### 3. Build the task queue

Convert incomplete tasks from the execution scope into active todos.

Rules:

- keep exactly one todo `in_progress`
- preserve task order unless dependencies require a different order
- note blockers before editing
- ignore `Follow-ups` unless the user explicitly asks for them
- when running all phases, queue work phase by phase in plan order instead of mixing tasks across phases

If the plan and codebase are out of sync, update the plan first when the correction is obvious. If not obvious, ask.

### 4. Implement task by task

Work phase by phase through the execution scope.

For each task:

1. Read the target files and nearby related code
2. Plan the smallest change that satisfies the task
3. Edit code with `apply_patch`
4. Update the matching checkbox in the planning doc immediately after completion
5. Keep status updates short and concrete

Implementation rules:

- follow `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` and `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- follow design/theme constraints from the planning doc when present
- reuse existing patterns before creating new abstractions
- keep changes incremental and within plan scope
- do not silently expand scope beyond the requested execution scope
- after finishing one incomplete phase, continue directly into the next incomplete phase when the default all-phases scope is active

### 5. Validate incrementally

Run the smallest useful validation first.

Prefer project-native checks such as:

- focused tests for touched code
- lint on changed files or the smallest supported scope
- type checks when types were affected
- build only when the phase or feature is complete, or when needed to prove correctness

Use `quality-code-check` when lint, typecheck, build, or validation debugging becomes the main task.

Fix issues caused by your changes before moving to the next task or phase.

### 6. Handle completion state

After each completed phase in the execution scope:

- if more in-scope phases remain, continue automatically unless the user explicitly asked for a single phase
- if all phases are complete, run final quality checks and summarize results
- if work stops early because of a blocker, report the blocker, affected phase, and exact resume point
- when all implementation tasks are complete, set `status: executed` in the feature plan frontmatter
- when work stops mid-plan, keep `status: reviewed` (do not change)
- if the planning doc frontmatter contains a non-null `epic_plan`, invoke `manage-epic` to sync the linked epic after this run
  - skip this entirely for standalone feature plans with no epic link

Keep the planning doc as the canonical progress tracker.

## When To Ask The User

Ask only when:

- the plan is missing or cannot be found
- a task description is too ambiguous to implement safely
- the required behavior conflicts with the current codebase
- a missing dependency or external service choice would materially change the solution

## Quality Bar

- Do not rework already-complete phases unless the user asks
- Do not leave completed code without matching checkbox updates
- Prefer a few verified edits over a broad speculative refactor
- Default behavior is to finish all remaining phases in the plan unless the user narrows the scope or a blocker prevents further progress
- Surface blockers explicitly with file references and reasons
