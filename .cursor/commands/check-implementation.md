Compare current implementation against planning and implementation notes.

1) Ask me for:
- Feature name (if not provided)
- Then locate docs by feature name:
  - Planning: `docs/ai/planning/feature-{name}.md`
  - Implementation (optional): `docs/ai/implementation/feature-{name}.md`

2) Validation Scope (no inference):
- Verify code follows the acceptance criteria from the planning doc
- Verify code matches the steps/changes in the implementation notes (when present)
- Do NOT invent or infer alternative logic beyond what the docs specify

3) Output
- List concrete mismatches between code and docs
- List missing pieces the docs require but code lacks
- Short actionable next steps
