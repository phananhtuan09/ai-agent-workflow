description: Requirement Orchestrator - Coordinates BA, SA, Researcher, and UI/UX agents to produce comprehensive requirements.
argument-hint: <feature-name>
---

## Goal

Orchestrate requirement gathering through specialized agents to produce a comprehensive requirement document at `docs/ai/requirements/req-{name}.md`.

This command coordinates:
- **BA Agent**: Business analysis, user stories, functional requirements
- **SA Agent**: Technical feasibility, architecture recommendations
- **Researcher Agent**: Domain terminology, external research (conditional)
- **UI/UX Agent**: Wireframes, screen flows (conditional)

---

## Workflow Alignment

- Provide brief status updates (1–3 sentences) before/after important actions.
- For medium/large tasks, create todos (≤14 words, verb-led). Keep only one `in_progress` item.
- Update todos immediately after progress; mark completed upon finish.
- Run agents in parallel where possible to optimize performance.

---

## Step 0: Pre-flight Check

### Check for Existing Requirement

**If user mentions existing requirement doc:**

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/req-{name}.md")
```

**Request orchestrator to ask user:**
```
{
  question: "Found existing requirement doc. What would you like to do?",
  header: "Mode",
  options: [
    { label: "Update existing", description: "Enhance with new agents, fill gaps" },
    { label: "Start fresh", description: "Archive current, create new" },
    { label: "Review only", description: "Show current state, identify gaps" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}
```

- **Update**: Load existing, identify what's missing, run relevant agents
- **Fresh**: Backup to `archive/`, start from scratch
- **Review**: Display summary, suggest next steps

---

## Step 1: Analyze User Prompt

### Parse Request

Analyze user prompt to determine:

| Aspect | Detection Method | Output |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Feature Type** | Keywords: UI, API, page, endpoint, database | `UI` / `API` / `Data` / `Full-stack` |
| **Complexity** | Scope indicators, number of features | `Simple` / `Medium` / `Complex` |
| **Domain Terms** | Industry jargon, unfamiliar terms | List of terms needing research |
| **UI Components** | Mentions of screens, forms, flows | Boolean: needs UI/UX |
| **Clarity Level** | How specific is the request | `Clear` / `Vague` / `Very Vague` |

### Determine Agent Strategy

Based on analysis:

| Scenario | Agents to Run | Execution |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Simple API feature | BA → SA | Sequential |
| Complex API feature | BA → SA | Sequential |
| Simple UI feature | BA + SA (parallel) → UI/UX | Mixed |
| Complex full-stack | BA → SA → UI/UX | Sequential |
| Domain-specific | BA + Researcher (parallel) → SA → UI/UX | Mixed |
| Very vague request | BA only first | Single, then reassess |

### Decision Output

```markdown
## Prompt Analysis

**Feature**: {derived name}
**Type**: {UI / API / Full-stack / Data}
**Complexity**: {Simple / Medium / Complex}
**Clarity**: {Clear / Vague / Very Vague}

**Agents Required**:
- [x] BA Agent (always)
- [x] SA Agent (always)
- [ ] Researcher Agent (domain terms detected: {list})
- [ ] UI/UX Agent (UI components needed)

**Execution Plan**:
1. {Step 1}
2. {Step 2}
...
```

---

## Step 2: Execute BA Agent

**Always runs first (or parallel with Researcher if domain terms detected)**

### Invoke BA Agent

```
Task(
  subagent_type='general-purpose',
  description='BA requirement analysis',
  prompt="Read agent definition: .claude/agents/requirement-ba.md

Execute the BA Agent workflow for feature: {feature-name}

User's original request:
---
{user prompt}
---

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md

Follow all steps in the agent definition. Present Q&A rounds to orchestrator for user clarification.
)
```

### BA Completion Check

After BA completes, verify output exists:
- `docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md`

Extract key info for next agents:
- Feature type confirmed
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Domain terms (if any discovered)

---

## Step 3: Execute Parallel Agents (Conditional)

Based on Step 1 analysis, run applicable agents in parallel.

### 3a: Researcher Agent (if domain terms detected)

```
Task(
  subagent_type='general-purpose',
  description='Domain research',
  prompt="Read agent definition: .claude/agents/requirement-researcher.md

Research the following terms/concepts for feature: {feature-name}

Terms to research:
- {term 1}
- {term 2}
- {term 3}

Context from BA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/research-{name}.md

Follow all steps in the agent definition.",
  run_in_background: true
)
```

### 3b: SA Agent (always)

```
Task(
  subagent_type='general-purpose',
  description='Solution architecture',
  prompt="Read agent definition: .claude/agents/requirement-sa.md

Perform technical feasibility assessment for feature: {feature-name}

BA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md

Read project standards:
- docs/ai/project/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md
- docs/ai/project/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/sa-{name}.md

Follow all steps in the agent definition.",
  run_in_background: true
)
```

### Wait for Parallel Agents

If running in background, use TaskOutput to collect results:

```
TaskOutput(task_id={researcher_task_id}, block=true)
TaskOutput(task_id={sa_task_id}, block=true)
```

---

## Step 4: Execute UI/UX Agent (Conditional)

**Only if UI components are needed (detected in Step 1)**

### Check if Needed

UI/UX Agent is needed if:
- Feature type is `UI` or `Full-stack`
- BA document mentions screens, forms, pages, dashboards
- User explicitly mentioned UI/UX in request

### Invoke UI/UX Agent

```
Task(
  subagent_type='general-purpose',
  description='UI/UX design',
  prompt="Read agent definition: .claude/agents/requirement-uiux.md

Design UI/UX for feature: {feature-name}

BA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md
SA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/sa-{name}.md (for constraints)

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/uiux-{name}.md

Follow all steps in the agent definition."
)
```

---

## Step 5: Resolve Conflicts (If Any)

### Check for Conflicts

Compare agent outputs for inconsistencies:

| Conflict Type | Detection | Resolution |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Feasibility** | SA says not feasible, BA has as must-have | Ask user to adjust priority or scope |
| **Technical** | SA recommends X, research shows Y is standard | Present both, let user decide |
| **Scope** | Agents produced different scope understanding | Clarify with user |

### Conflict Resolution

Request orchestrator to ask user:
```
{
  question: "Conflict detected: {describe conflict}. How should we proceed?",
  header: "Resolve",
  options: [
    { label: "{Option A}", description: "{Explanation}" },
    { label: "{Option B}", description: "{Explanation}" },
    { label: "Discuss further", description: "Need more context" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}
```

---

## Step 6: Consolidate Final Requirement

### Read Template

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/req-template.md")
```

### Gather All Agent Outputs

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md")
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/sa-{name}.md")
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/research-{name}.md")  # if exists
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/uiux-{name}.md")       # if exists
```

### Generate Consolidated Document

Create `docs/ai/requirements/req-{name}.md` with:

```markdown
# Requirement: {Feature Name}

> Generated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
> Status: Draft | Review | Approved
> Complexity: {Low / Medium / High}

## Decision Trees

### When to Skip Agents

```
Researcher Agent:
  ├── Domain terms detected? ─── Yes ──▶ Run
  └── No ──▶ Skip

UI/UX Agent:
  ├── Feature type UI or Full-stack? ─── Yes ──▶ Run
  ├── BA mentions screens/forms/pages? ─── Yes ──▶ Run
  └── No ──▶ Skip
```

### Complexity Escalation

```
Simple (1-2 Q&A rounds):
  └── Consider: "This seems straightforward. Proceed with full agent workflow or quick mode?"

Complex (many unknowns):
  └── Recommend: "This is complex. Suggest breaking down into smaller requirements."
```

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Agent fails | Retry once, then proceed without that agent's output |
| Template not found | Use fallback minimal structure |
| Conflict unresolved | Document as open question, proceed |
| User abandons Q&A | Save progress, allow resume |

---

## Notes

### Agent Output Files

All agent outputs are saved in `docs/ai/requirements/agents/`:
- `ba-{name}.md` - Business Analysis
- `sa-{name}.md` - Solution Architecture
- `research-{name}.md` - Domain Research
- `uiux-{name}.md` - UI/UX Design

These provide detailed backup and audit trail for the consolidated `req-{name}.md`.

### Integration with Planning

The consolidated requirement document is designed to be consumed by `/create-plan`:
- Section mappings are compatible with planning template
- Technical assessment informs architecture decisions
- UI/UX wireframes inform implementation phases

### Parallel Execution

Maximize parallelism where possible:
- BA + Researcher can run in parallel (if both needed)
- SA can start after BA completes (needs BA output)
- UI/UX can start after SA completes (needs both outputs)

Optimal parallel execution for full workflow:
```
BA ──────────────┐
                 ├──▶ SA ──────────┐
Researcher ──────┘                  ├──▶ UI/UX ──▶ Consolidate
                                    │
```
