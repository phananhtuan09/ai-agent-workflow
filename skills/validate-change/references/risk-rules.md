# Risk rules

This file is project-customizable: add, remove, or reword rules, change a level, or tune a setting. An edited copy is kept by `update --apply`.
`scripts/validate_change.py risk` reads the settings and the rules table below; editing them changes the next run without touching `SKILL.md`.
The rules are deterministic, so the same diff and the same expectation list always give the same gate. The thresholds are starting values; calibrate them on the project's own changes.

Levels:

- `high`: money, data, permissions, or weakened tests. Asks the human to confirm the expectations and flows before checks run, and adds the independent audit.
- `gate`: large or wide changes, configuration, and unconfirmed intent. Asks the human to confirm before checks run.
- `advisory`: listed in the report only.

Scopes:

- `path`: a regular expression matched against each changed file path.
- `added`, `removed`, `changed`: a regular expression matched against each added line, each removed line, or both.
- `builtin`: a check a single regular expression cannot express.

A regular expression is Python syntax; start it with `(?i)` to ignore case, and write a literal `|` as `\|` inside the table.
Files under `ignore` are left out of every rule and every count.

## Settings

- ignore: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, *.min.js, *.map, *.snap, dist/**, build/**, coverage/**, node_modules/**
- tests: *.test.*, *.spec.*, test/**, tests/**, e2e/**, __tests__/**
- max-lines: 500
- max-files: 25
- shared:

| `money-path` | high | path | `(?i)(^\|[/_.-])(payments?\|payouts?\|billing\|refunds?\|invoices?\|checkout\|pricing\|wallets?\|subscriptions?)` | A file about payments, billing, refunds, or pricing. |
| `data-path` | high | path | `(?i)(^\|/)(migrations?\|migrate\|prisma)/\|\.sql$\|(^\|/)(schema\.prisma\|models?\.py)$` | A migration, SQL file, or ORM schema. |
| `permission-path` | high | path | `(?i)(^\|[/_.-])(auth\|authz\|permissions?\|roles?\|polic(y\|ies)\|acl\|rbac\|guards?)([/_.A-Z-]\|$)` | A file about authentication, roles, or access policy. |
| `ci-path` | high | path | `(^\|/)\.github/workflows/\|(^\|/)CODEOWNERS$` | A CI workflow or code-owner rule. |
| `destructive-sql` | high | added | `(?i)\b(drop\s+(table\|column\|database\|index)\|truncate\|alter\s+table\|delete\s+from)\b` | A statement that drops, truncates, alters, or deletes stored data. |
| `access-check` | high | changed | `\b(isAdmin\|authorize\|requireRole\|hasRole\|hasPermission\|canAccess\|checkPermission\|verifyToken\|jwt\|bcrypt\|csrf)\b` | An access check or credential handling added or removed. |
| `money-math` | high | changed | `(?i)(amount\|currency\|refund\|charge\|discount\|subtotal\|price)\w*\s*(=[^=>]\|[*+/-]\s*[\w(]\|[<>]=?\s*\d)` | Arithmetic, assignment, or a limit on a money value. |
| `tests-skipped` | high | added | `\b(it\|test\|describe)\.(skip\|only\|todo)\(\|\bx(it\|describe)\(\|@pytest\.mark\.skip` | A test skipped, focused, or left as a todo. |
| `tests-deleted` | high | builtin | `builtin:tests-deleted` | A test file deleted by the change. |
| `size` | gate | builtin | `builtin:size` | The change is larger than `max-lines` changed lines or `max-files` files. |
| `shared` | gate | builtin | `builtin:shared` | A file matching the `shared` setting, such as a design-system component or a utility many routes import. |
| `env-file` | gate | path | `(^\|/)\.env(\.\|$)` | An environment file. |
| `env-var` | gate | added | `process\.env\.\w+\|import\.meta\.env\.\w+\|os\.environ\|getenv\(` | Code that reads an environment variable. |
| `dependency-major` | gate | builtin | `builtin:dependency-major` | A dependency in `package.json` moved to a new major version. |
| `agent-intent-only` | gate | builtin | `builtin:agent-intent-only` | No expectation comes from a human prompt or spec. |
| `intent-conflict` | gate | builtin | `builtin:intent-conflict` | The expectation list records a conflict between sources; the human resolves it at the gate. |
| `flag-default` | advisory | changed | `(?i)\b\w*(feature\|flag\|toggle)\w*\s*[:=]\s*(true\|false)\b` | A feature-flag default set or flipped. |
