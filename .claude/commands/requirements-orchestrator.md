description: Requirement Orchestrator - Coordinates BA, SA, Researcher, and UI/UX agents to produce comprehensive requirements.
---

## Goal

Orchestrate requirement gathering through specialized agents to produce a comprehensive requirement document at `docs/ai/requirements/req-{name}.md`.

This command coordinates:
- **BA Agent**: Business analysis, user stories, functional requirements
- **SA Agent**: Technical feasibility, architecture recommendations
- **Researcher Agent**: Domain terminology, external research (conditional)
- **UI/UX Agent**: Wireframes, screen flows (conditional)

---

## Workflow Alignment

- Provide brief status updates (1–3 sentences) before/after important actions.
- For medium/large tasks, create todos (≤14 words, verb-led). Keep only one `in_progress` item.
- Update todos immediately after progress; mark completed upon finish.
- Run agents in parallel where possible to optimize performance.

---

## Step 0: Pre-flight Check

### Check for Existing Requirement

**If user mentions existing requirement doc:**

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/req-{name}.md")
```

**Ask user:**
```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  question: "Found existing requirement doc. What would you like to do?",
  header: "Mode",
  options: [
    { label: "Update existing", description: "Enhance with new agents, fill gaps" },
    { label: "Start fresh", description: "Archive current, create new" },
    { label: "Review only", description: "Show current state, identify gaps" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

- **Update**: Load existing, identify what's missing, run relevant agents
- **Fresh**: Backup to `archive/`, start from scratch
- **Review**: Display summary, suggest next steps

---

## Step 1: Analyze User Prompt

### Extract Structured Context

Before analyzing, extract any structured context the user provided:

| Slot | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Tech constraints** | Existing stack, perf budget, timeline | User prompt or ask |
| **Related artifacts** | Figma paths, epic path, API docs links | User prompt or skip |
| **Feature boundary** | What is explicitly in vs out | User prompt or ask |

If tech constraints or feature boundary are missing and the feature is Medium/Complex, ask before running agents.

### Parse Request

Analyze user prompt to determine:

| Aspect | Detection Method | Output |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Feature Type** | Keywords: UI, API, page, endpoint, database | `UI` / `API` / `Data` / `Full-stack` |
| **Complexity** | Scope indicators, number of features | `Simple` / `Medium` / `Complex` |
| **Domain Terms** | Industry jargon, unfamiliar terms | List of terms needing research |
| **UI Needed** | Mentions of screens, forms, flows, pages | Boolean: needs UI/UX |

### Determine Workflow Mode

Based on Complexity, ask user to confirm mode:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  question: "Feature complexity detected as {Simple/Medium/Complex}. Which workflow mode?",
  header: "Mode",
  options: [
    { label: "Light mode", description: "BA → SA → Consolidate (fast, low token cost)" },
    { label: "Full mode", description: "BA → SA → Researcher/UI/UX → Consolidate (thorough)" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

**Light Mode** (for Simple features or when user prefers speed):
- Agents: BA → SA → Consolidate
- Skip Researcher and UI/UX agents
- Q&A: focus on critical unknowns only, stop when BA has enough to write
- Smaller consolidated output

**Full Mode** (for Complex features or when user wants thoroughness):
- Full agent workflow as described in subsequent steps
- All conditional agents evaluated
- Max 3 Q&A rounds total; after round 3 mark remaining unknowns as [ASSUMPTION] and continue

### Determine Agent Strategy

Based on analysis and mode:

| Scenario | Mode | Agents to Run | Execution |
|----------|------|---------------|-----------|
| Simple API feature | Light | BA → SA | Sequential |
| Simple UI feature | Light | BA → SA | Sequential |
| Complex API feature | Full | BA → SA | Sequential |
| Complex full-stack | Full | BA → SA → UI/UX | Sequential |
| Domain-specific | Full | BA → (SA + Researcher parallel) → UI/UX | Mixed |
| Any feature | Light | BA → SA | Sequential |

### Decision Output

```markdown
## Prompt Analysis

**Feature**: {derived name}
**Type**: {UI / API / Full-stack / Data}
**Complexity**: {Simple / Medium / Complex}
**Mode**: {Light / Full}

**Agents Required**:
- [x] BA Agent (always)
- [x] SA Agent (always)
- [ ] Researcher Agent (domain terms detected: {list}) — Full mode only
- [ ] UI/UX Agent (UI components needed) — Full mode only

**Execution Plan**:
1. {Step 1}
2. {Step 2}
...
```

---

## Step 2: Execute BA Agent

**Orchestrator handles Q&A directly — avoids expensive sub-agent resume pattern.**

### 2a: Orchestrator Q&A

Collect requirements directly — **do not delegate Q&A to the BA sub-agent** (avoids expensive resume pattern).

Conduct Q&A rounds yourself using `AskUserQuestion`. Tailor questions and options to the specific feature. Apply judgment on how many rounds are needed:

| Mode | Guidance |
|------|----------|
| Light | Focus on unknowns critical for BA to write the document. Stop when you have enough. |
| Full | Deeper exploration. After round 3, mark remaining unknowns as `[ASSUMPTION]` and continue. |

After each round, decide: are there still blockers that would prevent BA from writing a clear document? If yes, ask another round. If no, proceed.

After collecting all answers, record them as a structured `[ANSWERS]` block and proceed to spawn.

### 2b: Spawn BA Agent (write-only)

```
Task(
  subagent_type='requirement-ba',
  description='BA requirement analysis',
  prompt="[WRITE-ONLY MODE] - Answers already collected. Skip Q&A steps entirely.

Feature: {feature-name}

User's original request:
---
{user prompt}
---

[ANSWERS]
{paste collected answers here}
[/ANSWERS]

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md"
)
```

### BA Completion Check

After BA completes, verify output exists:
- `docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md`

Extract key info for next agents:
- Feature type confirmed
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Domain terms (if any discovered)

---

## Step 3: Execute Parallel Agents (Conditional)

Based on Step 1 analysis, run applicable agents in parallel.

### 3a: Researcher Agent (if domain terms detected)

```
Task(
  subagent_type='requirement-researcher',
  description='Domain research',
  prompt="Research the following terms/concepts for feature: {feature-name}

Terms to research:
- {term 1}
- {term 2}
- {term 3}

Context from BA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/research-{name}.md",
  run_in_background: true
)
```

### 3b: SA Agent (always)

Before spawning SA, pre-read project context files in the orchestrator (cheap, predictable cost). This replaces codebase exploration and ensures SA recommendations fit the actual stack.

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/project/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md")   # capture as {conventions_content}
Read(file_path="docs/ai/project/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md")  # capture as {structure_content}
Read(file_path="AGENTS.md")                              # capture as {agents_content}, if exists
```

If a file doesn't exist, use `"(not available)"` as its placeholder.

Pass all captured content inline. SA agent does not need to read any files — use `[LIGHT MODE]` flag for both Light and Full mode (Explore sub-agent is never needed when context is provided):

```
Task(
  subagent_type='requirement-sa',
  description='Solution architecture',
  prompt="[LIGHT MODE] - Use inline project context below. Do not run codebase Explore sub-agent.

Perform technical feasibility assessment for feature: {feature-name}

BA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md

[INLINE PROJECT CONTEXT]
CODE_CONVENTIONS.md:
---
{conventions_content}
---

PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md:
---
{structure_content}
---

AGENTS.md:
---
{agents_content}
---
[/INLINE PROJECT CONTEXT]

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/sa-{name}.md",
  run_in_background: true
)
```

### Wait for Parallel Agents

If running in background, use TaskOutput to collect results:

```
TaskOutput(task_id={researcher_task_id}, block=true)
TaskOutput(task_id={sa_task_id}, block=true)
```

---

## Step 4: Execute UI/UX Agent (Conditional)

**Only if UI components are needed (detected in Step 1)**

### Check if Needed

UI/UX Agent is needed if:
- Feature type is `UI` or `Full-stack`
- BA document mentions screens, forms, pages, dashboards
- User explicitly mentioned UI/UX in request

### Invoke UI/UX Agent

```
Task(
  subagent_type='requirement-uiux',
  description='UI/UX design',
  prompt="Design UI/UX for feature: {feature-name}

BA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md
SA document: docs/ai/requirements/agents/sa-{name}.md (for constraints)

Output to: docs/ai/requirements/agents/uiux-{name}.md"
)
```

---

## Step 5: Resolve Conflicts (If Any)

### Check for Conflicts

Compare agent outputs for inconsistencies:

| Conflict Type | Detection | Resolution |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Feasibility** | SA says not feasible, BA has as must-have | Ask user to adjust priority or scope |
| **Technical** | SA recommends X, research shows Y is standard | Present both, let user decide |
| **Scope** | Agents produced different scope understanding | Clarify with user |

### Conflict Resolution

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  question: "Conflict detected: {describe conflict}. How should we proceed?",
  header: "Resolve",
  options: [
    { label: "{Option A}", description: "{Explanation}" },
    { label: "{Option B}", description: "{Explanation}" },
    { label: "Discuss further", description: "Need more context" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

---

## Step 6: Consolidate Final Requirement

### Read Template

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/req-template.md")
```

### Gather All Agent Outputs

```
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/ba-{name}.md")
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/sa-{name}.md")
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/research-{name}.md")  # if exists
Read(file_path="docs/ai/requirements/agents/uiux-{name}.md")       # if exists
```

### Generate Consolidated Document

Create `docs/ai/requirements/req-{name}.md` with:

```markdown
# Requirement: {Feature Name}

> Generated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
> Status: Draft | Review | Approved
> Complexity: {Low / Medium / High}

## Decision Trees

### When to Skip Agents

```
Researcher Agent:
  ├── Domain terms detected? ─── Yes ──▶ Run
  └── No ──▶ Skip

UI/UX Agent:
  ├── Feature type UI or Full-stack? ─── Yes ──▶ Run
  ├── BA mentions screens/forms/pages? ─── Yes ──▶ Run
  └── No ──▶ Skip
```

### Complexity Escalation

```
Simple (1-2 Q&A rounds):
  └── Default to Light mode. User can override to Full mode.

Medium (2-3 Q&A rounds):
  └── Ask user to choose Light or Full mode.

Complex (many unknowns):
  └── Default to Full mode. Recommend breaking down into smaller requirements.
```

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Agent fails | Retry once, then proceed without that agent's output |
| Template not found | Use fallback minimal structure |
| Conflict unresolved | Document as open question, proceed |
| User abandons Q&A | Save progress, allow resume |

---

## Notes

### Agent Output Files

All agent outputs are saved in `docs/ai/requirements/agents/`:
- `ba-{name}.md` - Business Analysis
- `sa-{name}.md` - Solution Architecture
- `research-{name}.md` - Domain Research
- `uiux-{name}.md` - UI/UX Design

These provide detailed backup and audit trail for the consolidated `req-{name}.md`.

### Integration with Planning

The consolidated requirement document is designed to be consumed by `/create-plan`:
- Section mappings are compatible with planning template
- Technical assessment informs architecture decisions
- UI/UX wireframes inform implementation phases

### Parallel Execution

Maximize parallelism where possible:
- BA + Researcher can run in parallel (if both needed)
- SA can start after BA completes (needs BA output)
- UI/UX can start after SA completes (needs both outputs)

Optimal parallel execution for full workflow:
```
Q&A (orchestrator)
    ↓
BA (write-only)
    ↓
SA ──────────────┐
                  ├──▶ UI/UX ──▶ Consolidate
Researcher ──────┘
```

SA and Researcher both depend on BA output — run them in parallel after BA completes.
