# Code Conventions

This document is auto-generated by the `generate-standards` command.

Do not edit manually. To influence the generated content, edit the preload templates instead:
- `docs/ai/project/template-convention/common.md` (always loaded first)
- `docs/ai/project/template-convention/javascript.md` (loaded if JS/TS repo)
- `docs/ai/project/template-convention/react.md` (loaded if React is detected)

The generator merges the above templates (when present) and then appends auto-discovered rules from the codebase.
