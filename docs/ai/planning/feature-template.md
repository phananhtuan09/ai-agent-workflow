# Plan: {Feature Name}

Note: All content in this document must be written in English.

## 1. Goal & Acceptance Criteria

### Goal
- [Brief description: what problem this solves and why it matters]

### Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Given [context or initial state]
- When [action or event occurs]
- Then [expected result or outcome]

## 2. Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
- [Potential issues, blockers, or unknowns]

### Assumptions
- [What we assume is true for this plan to work]

## 3. Definition of Done
- [ ] Build passes (linter, type checks, compile)
- [ ] Tests added and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Summary
[Brief description of the solution approach in 1-3 sentences]

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

- [ ] [ACTION] path/to/file — Summary of change
  ```
  Pseudo-code:
  - Step 1: describe what will be done
  - Step 2: validation or key logic
  - Step 3: output or return value
  ```

- [ ] [ACTION] path/to/file — Summary of change
  ```
  Pseudo-code:
  - ...
  ```

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

- [ ] [ACTION] path/to/file — Summary of change
  ```
  Pseudo-code:
  - ...
  ```

Notes:
- ACTION must be one of: ADDED | MODIFIED | DELETED | RENAMED
- For MODIFIED files, use sub-bullets for each distinct logic change and include line ranges
- Pseudo-code shows logic structure and key steps, not actual implementation code
- Each phase groups related tasks; phases execute sequentially
- Use only one phase for small features (≤ 5 tasks); use multiple phases for larger features

## 5. Follow-ups
- [ ] [TODO item or deferred work]
- [ ] [Future improvements]
